AERS is a Computer Vision-enabled fire detection model which identifies fires and smoke, for which it uses a CCTV surveillance to monitor a specific area. It is currently under development to provide a more in-depth analysis of the situation, including live threat tracking, fire type identification and fire source location detection. It will be able to connect to public safety departments and provide them with all the required data.


We address the critical issue of delayed response during fire emergencies, where fires are often detected too late, leading to significant loss of life and property. Traditional fire alarms and manual reporting systems are slow and prone to human error, especially in areas without modern detection infrastructure. Also, these aren't always directly linked to emergency services. This causes fire response delays, increasing the damage scale before help arrives.
AERS provides a real-time fire detection system that sends instant alerts to both occupants and emergency responders, drastically reducing response times. By integrating modern technology into fire detection, AERS improves accuracy and ensures quicker action, minimizing the risks associated with fires and offering better protection for both lives and property.

Costs will primarily be driven by hardware and R&D expenses. The development, production, and installation of fire detection cameras will form a large portion of the budget. Additionally, continuous software development to ensure accurate fire detection, data storage, and real-time alerts will be a recurring cost. Other significant expenses include personnel (for installation, customer service, and tech support), cloud infrastructure, and marketing. Revenue will be influenced by market penetration, strategic partnerships, and competitor dynamics.
